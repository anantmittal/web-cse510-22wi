# Course Overview

## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to forms of contribution in several major areas of research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
It is based in a combination of readings and discussion, a small statistics lab, and a self-defined project.
The course readings will require preparing reports on a combination of historic framing papers and more recent contributions.
This will help students examine what the HCI community considers a research contribution across a variety of problems,
thus preparing students to understand and make meaningful research contributions in these and other areas of HCI.

This course is explicitly not focused on the design methods commonly used in HCI practice.
We do not assume a strong background in HCI (i.e., there is no undergraduate HCI prerequisite),
but students seeking an introduction to effective design or the design process will be better served by CSE 440.

The course project will require hands-on experience with HCI, while remaining open to different possibilities.
You might choose to design and implement a new piece of HCI technology,
or you might choose to design and execute an appropriately compelling study with HCI research implications.

We will emphasize open discussion and feedback in all aspects of the course.

## Learning Objectives

- Be able to differentiate forms of contribution in HCI research.
- Be able to describe prior fundamental results that now frame areas of HCI research.
- Be able to articulate new contributions in such areas of HCI research.
- Be able to apply and evaluate relevance of common HCI research methods.
- Be able to contribute advice and perspective across multiple HCI research projects.

## Grading

Much of the grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
We will attempt to communicate expectations and feedback throughout the course,
but it is your responsibility to communicate with us if you would like additional guidance in this regard.

The overall course grade will be computed as follows:

- 20%: Reading Reports and In-Class Small Group Discussion

  Reading reports will be graded 0 to 2 points as described in [Reading Reports](/assignments/readings#reading-reports).
  As this offering explores a new [In-Class Discussion Format](/assignments/readings#in-class-discussion-format),
  an additional .5 points will be associated with each small group discussion and its resulting question to the presenter and the class.

- 45%: Project
  - 5%: Proposal Preparation and Document
  - 5%: Milestone 1 Report and Presentation
  - 5%: Milestone 2 Report and Presentation
  - 30%: Final Report

  Project proposal and milestone grading will emphasize progress and preparation to engage with direction and feedback.
  Strong grades will result from honest presentation of project status
  and useful scaffolding of a conversation that can support the project
  (e.g., realistic and concrete proposals, clear discussion of advice that a project currently needs).
  Proposals or milestones that are vague, incomplete, or oversold all
  fail to take full advantage of an opportunity for feedback.

  Final project report grading will then emphasize overall project execution
  and appropriate presentation of project activities (e.g., clarity of activities, methods, and contributions).

- 10%: Statistics Lab, as described in [Statistics Lab](/assignments/statisticslab).
- 15%: Exam, as described in [Exam](/assignments/exam).
- 10%: Participation

  A participation grade corresponds to course goals for students to
  actively develop skills in discussing research activities and contributions
  (e.g., when discussing existing research, when discussing ongoing research).
  Participation will therefore include presence and participation in in-class reading discussions,
  participation in asynchronous and in-class discussions of projects, and other course activities.
  A goal of this offering is to make such participation components more explicit and transparent.

## Wellness and Safety

We are all living in challenging times.
Our goal is for this course to provide an opportunity for learning without undermining wellness or safety.

We will conduct many course activities virtually,
using meeting information provided by email and in [Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1519807).
The course [Calendar](/calendar) will indicate when class itself will be conducted virtually
(e.g., due to emerging UW policies, due to a need or request from a guest presenter).

Prior to class, we will accept any email indicating that a student cannot attend for reasons of wellness or safety.
We will work to ensure this does not negatively impact students (e.g., in their participation grade),
in part by developing straightforward approaches for students to "make up" a missed opportunity.

We also welcome any additional feedback in how we can best structure this course while ensuring this goal.

## Accommodations and Additional University Policies

Additional university policies apply 
(e.g., regarding Academic Integrity, Conduct, Disability Resources, Face Coverings, Religious Accommodations):

Please do not hesitate to contact the course staff regarding these or any other accommodations.
